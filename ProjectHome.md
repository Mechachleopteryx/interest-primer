This is a very trivial software example appearing in Chapter 4 in the 4th edition of the book "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python", by H. P. Langtangen, Springer, 2014. The purpose is to show how to make a Python module, distribute it with a setup.py script, and make the files available here at Googlecode.

The module can compute with a formula for interest rates, see interest.py for details.

To install the software, run

> sudo python setup.py install

The file interest.py is installed both as a module and as an executable program.
